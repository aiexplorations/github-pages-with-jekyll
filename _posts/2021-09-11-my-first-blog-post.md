# First Github.io blog post

I'm writing this post to experiment with Jekyll, the Github workflows and other cool stuff which enables direct publishing of blogs from a markdown script.

In future I imagine that blogging is going to become as easy as writing code or markdown in a local repo, pushing it to the remote repo, and then allowing the Github workflows to do the rest.

The benefit I had with Wordpress.com was WYSIWYG but increasingly, the block based post editor there was making it hard for me to do some things. I think that by building a website or blog using Github I should be able to do much more by just using a repo.

I can also hope for the repo and all its contents to be managed as per usual with Github commands and everything is in Markdown. So if I have to move, I can always rely on Markdown-to-HTML or some other way, rather than have my posts be locked into Wordpress (in a manner of speaking).

Wordpress should also allow me to export my existing posts, so that's something I should try too.

Anyway, more in the next post!
